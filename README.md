# DE10-LITE-Digital-Oscilloscope-with-FFT
DE10-LITE digital oscilloscope implemented in Verilog and C# for user interface

Implementation of a one channel oscilloscope using DE10-LITE MAX10 built in ADC.

This project shows a very basic application to interactwith the ADC & JTAG built into the MAX10.
If you have theoretical backround on these components you can use this project to understand how these components are used together as a digital oscilloscope.

The system is comprised mainly of a JTAG, ADC & DDS module
